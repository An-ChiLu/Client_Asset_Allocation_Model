# Client Asset Allocation Modeling with Machine Learning

## Overview
This project explores how client demographic, financial, and behavioral data can be used to model portfolio asset allocation decisions.
The goal is to simulate a data-driven wealth management workflow, where client profiles are mapped to diversified portfolio allocations across multiple asset classes.

The problem is framed as a multi-output regression task, predicting allocation weights that sum to one for each client.
